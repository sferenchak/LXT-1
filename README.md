## The Task

**Part 1: Teach us something new, in any digital format you choose**
Pick an emerging learning trend or technology that you define as “innovative” that would be interesting to a modern learner and teach us more about it. We encourage you to have fun with the design of this learning experience  it’s your opportunity to show us how you think about constructing learnings for a fast paced, innovative team.

**Deliverable:** A quick digital learning experience, 5 minutes maximum. 

## Overview

For this task, I opted to create the learning exerience using Storyline 360 given the scope of the deliverables and the timeframe available. I focused on implementing various gamification techniques such as badging, point systems, and a fun design aesthetic while leveraging content from wikipedia regarding the topic itself rather than attempting to write, design, and build from scratch. Total design and build time was approximately 6-7 hours from initial concept idea to publish.

## Main Features

- **Fun, Engaging Design**
  - The UI was built to mimic an arcade cabinet.
- **Badge System**
  - Various badges are unlocked for acheiving different goals throughout the training like, pressing the "Start" button to begin, setting a new high score, and completing all content.
- **Point System**
  - Points can be gained for each piece of content viewed as well as answering questions correctly.
- **Visual Progress**
  - The game character moves along the bottom as you progress through the module.

## Extra Information

- *Additional detail/context about any project elements where needed*
  - The assets are a mix of self-created, modified royalty-free, and prebuilt icons/assets available from the Storyline 360 library to speed up creation of the learning experience.
- *Why you created these the way you did (your technical perspective)*
  - The main reason I created everything the way I did was to focus on the implementation aspects of the learning experience rather than writing the content itself. 
- *What tools you used to accomplish the project*
  - I leveraged Storyline 360, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe Photoshop
- *Tradeoffs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project*
  - Were I to have more available time, I would have written my own content and implemented it in a more story-driven, interactive narrative style. I also would have included some fun music and other sound effects.
- *Links to the final products (hosting, if needed, is up to you)*
